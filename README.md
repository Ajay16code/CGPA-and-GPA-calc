## Calculation Formulas

### GPA Calculation

\[
\text{GPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Credit Hours} \times \text{Grade Point})}{\text{Total Credit Hours}}
\]

**Example:**

| Course   | Credits | Grade Point | Points |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Math     |    3    |   4.0       | 12.0   |
| English  |    4    |   3.5       | 14.0   |
| Science  |    2    |   3.7       | 7.4    |

GPA = (12.0 + 14.0 + 7.4) / (3 + 4 + 2) = 33.4 / 9 = **3.71**

---

### CGPA Calculation

\[
\text{CGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Credit Hours} \times \text{Grade Point})}{\text{Total Credit Hours (All Semesters)}}
\]

For two semesters with GPAs 2.81 (17 credits) and 1.92 (18 credits):

CGPA = (47.8 + 34.5) / (17 + 18) = 82.3 / 35 = **2.35**

---

### CGPA Percentage (Scale of 10)

\[
\text{CGPA\%} = \text{CGPA} \times 9.5
\]

**Example**: CGPA = 8.1, Percentage = 8.1 Ã— 9.5 = **76.95%**
